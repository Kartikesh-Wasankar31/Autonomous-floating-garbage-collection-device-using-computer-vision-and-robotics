# Autonomous-floating-garbage-collection-device-using-computer-vision-and-robotics

This research presents an autonomous device for collecting floating watery waste. It uses an ESP-32 cam for real time images, an arduino uno for movement, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance, and the yolo V3 algorithm for garbage detection.
